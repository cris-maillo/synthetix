# Vibe Coding an Electronic Music Ticket Platform Fake Data Generator

I've been ruminating for quite some time about working on a personal project that can help me hone the skills I need for my job as a Data Consultant. I've always found "data problems" to be a bit harder to reduce down into a personal project - mostly due to most problems mostly happening at enterprise-level (e.g. scalability issues, data quality, legacy systems...).

Therefore, I wanted to create a fake dataset? (not sure if that is the right word) to approximately recreate that data landscape so that I can use it throughout different challenges & learn data skills in practice. 

Being the club rat that I am (I guess I should say _was_ - I'm almost 26 and my knees can't take it), I finally decided on mocking a ticketing platform, focused on electronic music events. 

I'll be using this dev diary as a lab book, so that I can track my progress & discuss challenges that I will find as I work on synthetix.

I was finding it a bit hard to kick-start this project and I eventually reached a breaking point and downloaded cursor, with the aim of letting go of some of my apprehension of using AI for learning.
Unsurprisingly, it went very well, it quickly got me to a point where I could generate data, in a very well-organised repo even with my rusty python skills.

However, no matter the _vibe codingness_ , I was not satisfied with the data architecture itself, and no matter the number of prompts, it was slowing becoming more clear that I had to do something unimaginable: stop and think.

> side note: i am so dramatic, why did I chose to do a lab book when every time I write I just slowly descend into ??? I don't even know how to describe this. ANYWAYS.

I had issues defining roles in the app (e.g. who creates the events? who should have access to edit the event?), I could not figure out a technical solution on how are tickets validated on the night and I could not describe the relationship between ticket/purchase/owner in a way that made sense to me.

At this point, it was clear I had to bring pen to paper and sketch out the system in depth.

Also, my main aim with this project was to create a fun dataset that I would be excited to use, and even if I was so impressed by Faker, the content itself was meaningless and in turn - boring. As an example:

| Real Name    | Artist Name | Bio |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Samantha Hickman  | Katrina Smith   | Action own leader theory rise weight much.  |

Therefore, I think I'll be using some degree of scraped data (or maybe even using an LLM) to generate more realistic sounding values.

Finally, for the data challenges I'll be working through with this data, I need it to have data quality issues, to be complex, & ideally show a degree of realness for analytics exercises down the line (e.g. London having more events). I'm not yet very sure on how I can make this happen.

Overall, I'm quite happy with my vibe coding start - it got me started - which as you will know, it's always the trickiest bit.

I did a quick vibe code of the data model using MermaidJS and draw.io (I also found out that Github can parse MermaidJS which is cool!). But I think I want to put a bit more thought into it.

Back to basics, what is my first step?
From what I can recall from Uni & training, there are 3 main models, but I do wonder if this is a bit pass√©:
1. Conceptual Model: also known as domain models, big-picture view of the system. Focus on entities/classes and their relationships & constraints between them.
2. Logical Model: includes attributes and data types
3. Physical Data Model: finalised design, includes associative tables and primary & foreign keys.

At this point, I'm moving on to pen and paper but I will hopefully create .md files for each stage and any iteration.

For the conceptual model, I'll be first listing the entities:
1. Event (I will have to consider if I'd want and how to enable multi-day events or series)
2. Customer
3. Artist
4. Promoter
5. Venue Manager
6. Venue
7. Ticket
8. Sale (ChatGPT recommends separating Sale/Order from Payment, but I will keep them together for now)

And creating relationships in an ERD which can be seen in the final Conceptual ERD.

Let's move on to the logical data model, adding attributes and data types.
